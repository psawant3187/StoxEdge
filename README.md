Portfolio optimization is a quantitative investment strategy that aims to construct an investment portfolio that maximizes the potential return while minimizing the associated risk. The primary goal of portfolio optimization is to find an optimal allocation of assets that will provide the best possible trade-off between risk and return for a given set of investment constraints.
